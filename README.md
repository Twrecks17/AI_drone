# AI_Drone

A program to control a quadcopter.

## Details

The code is written to be run on a BeagleBone black. It will include basic
control operations for the copter to be manually run, as well as different
artificial intelligence algorithms.

## TODO

* Get motor control working through I/O ports
* Create schematics and modeling files for the actual device
* Input and use accelerometers, object detectors, and other inputs
* Allow device to hover and take in basic commands sent to it
* Implement beginning artifical intelligence to wander without collisions
* Add more specialized AI for "battles" between separate copters
